this is a quick over view of the development process in Jupyter
1. examining the stucture of .db files
2. examining the stucture of several of the data frames
3. manually checking duplicates and NaN values (code was removed from jupyter)
4. rev 1 of clean_loader was written to use connectors that where previously established in notebook
5. testing was done to ensure that files where generated 

-python code has been exported transfered to .py
